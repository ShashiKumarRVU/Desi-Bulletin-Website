The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on December 11 cautioned public not to fall prey to misleading advertisements related to loan waiver offers in print media as well as on social media platforms.
In a statement, the RBI said it has noticed certain misleading advertisements enticing borrowers by offering loan waivers.
These entities, it said, seem to be actively promoting many such campaigns across the print media as well as social media platforms.
There are also reports of such entities charging a service/legal fee for issuing 'debt waiver certificates' without any authority.
The central bank further said that in certain locations, campaigns related to debt waiver offers are being run by a few persons, which undermine the efforts of banks in enforcing their rights.
"Such entities are misrepresenting that dues to financial institutions including banks need not be repaid. Such activities undermine the stability of financial institutions and, above all, the interest of the depositors," the RBI said.
RBI cautioned that associating with such entities can result in direct financial losses.<a href="https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/rbi-cautions-against-unauthorised-campaigns-on-loan-waiver/article67626822.ece" style="color: yellow;" target="_blank">Read more</a>

Despite challenges in the global chemical market, Indian chemical companies are expecting to see signs of recovery in margins from H2 FY24. This 
recovery, the company officials say, is driven by increased interest from global companies in sourcing from India, a rising share of specialty chemicals, and robust 
capital expenditures by Indian chemical firms. Long-term prospects of the Indian chemical industry remain positive, given lower cost of production, government incentive
schemes as well good domestic demand,‚Äù said Vinati Saraf Mutreja, Managing director, Vinati Organics Ltd. 

Supporting the views, a recent research report from capital market company SMIFS Limited, indicated that key export markets such as the US and Europe are currently
experiencing a slow demand pace with the worst phase of global destocking in the agrochemical space likely behind, and normalcy is expected to resume soon.

The chemical industry, the report said, is finding ways through volatile commodity prices attributed to heightened competition, geopolitical tensions, supply cuts
by Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) affecting crude oil supplies, and uncertainties in demand.
