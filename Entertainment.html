covering the period between January to June 2023, Netflix disclosed the viewership data for both original and licensed content, encompassing about 99 per cent of all viewing on the streaming platform. 
No Indian show or movie made it to the top-20 list. The Night Agent was followed by season two of Ginny & Georgia with 665.1 million hours and Korean drama The Glory with 622.8 million hours. Series 
Wednesday, which was released in November 2022, ranked fourth at 507.7 million hours of viewing. The top 10 titles included -- Queen Charlotte:A Bridgerton Story, You season four, La Seina del Sur season

From the licensed shows, Suits had a combined 599 million hours of viewing worldwide on Netflix across all nine seasons. Netflix said it will begin sharing bi-annual reports, which will rank almost all of its 
shows and movies by amount of hours viewed over the past six months. "Over the last 16 years of streaming one constant has been people asking for more viewing information," Netflix co-Chief Executive Officer Ted 
Sarandos said on a call with journalists. "It's a comprehensive deep dive into what people are watching on Netflix around the world and it is an important milestone for our industry," he added The company,Sarandos
said, has been getting "increasingly transparent about what people are watching on Netflix". Netflix had attracted criticism for not sharing the viewership data, especially during the twin strikes by the Writers 
Guild of America (WGA) and Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA).

                   <b> Animal' which released on December 1 has become a huge talking point all over the internet. Various aspects of the 
and particular scenes or dialogues are largely been spoken about. While it has gotten a lot of criticism, there's also a huge section of the
audience who's completely in love with some of the performances and characters in the movie. Bobby Deol just has an extended cameo of sort in the
film as the actor has very less screen time. Yet, Bobby has got immense appreciation for his performance. While his entry song has gone viral in the 
movie, fans cannoot stop gushing over him, despite the fact that he didn't have any dialogues. His character Abrar has three wives in the movie and
he's seen indulging in marital rape in the movie. Bobby has finally reacted to this scene and all the reviews   'Animal'. He said that they're not 
trying to promote maritl rape or anything of that sort. However, it was required. Because how else does one showcase a character in such a showcase
a character in such a short span or how else does one showcase a character in such a short span or how else does on show what a man is capable of 
or what kind of person he is. Hence those scenes were required.
