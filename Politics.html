Former Rajasthan CM Vasundhara Raje and incumbent Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan remain to be tough contenders for the race.With the announcement of the first-ever tribal chief
minister for Chhattisgarh, the Bharatiya Janata Party began to scotch the suspense over selecting candidates for the top position more than a week after the party won in the heartland
states in the assembly elections. The party will now take the much-anticipated decision to pick chief ministers for Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.
                    
Bridgetown: Forde, Carty power Windies to series victory over Following the trend in Chhattisgarh and amid recent buzz, the BJP is likely to opt for a new line of leadership in the remaining 
states. However, former Rajasthan CM Vasundhara Raje and incumbent Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan remain to be tough contenders for the race.The BJP’s newly elected Madhya Pradesh MLAs
will meet in Bhopal on Monday to elect the leader of the legislative party, people aware of the matter said. The meeting will be supervised by Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, national
secretary Asha Lakra and Rajya Sabha MP K Laxman who were announced as party observers for Madhya Pradesh. The observers will hold one-on-one meetings with senior state leaders and legislators.
The BJP retained Madhya Pradesh at a canter winning 163 seats in the 230-member assembly, leaving the Congress a distant second with 66 seats.
Saying that the new state cabinet will carry a sizeable tribal representation, senior leader and outgoing minister Om Prakash Dhurve said: “In the new cabinet, tribal leaders will get a good 
opportunity to work for the welfare of tribal and others.”

            <b>  <pre style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">NEW DELHI: The Congress on Wednesday said that Karnataka wil be at the centre of the grand old party's
election strategy  or the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. The party also announceced that it will soon start the process of selecting candidates for the parliamentary elections.
"We believe that the people of Karnataka are going to bless the Congress with more than 20 seats in the Lok Sabha polls.We hope that this number could go even beyond 25 and we would be 
able to sweep the polls in the state," Congress leader Randeep Surjewala said.The Congress's enthusiasm and optimism about possible Lok Sabha sweep in Karnataka stems from the grand success
 the party achieved in the state assembly elections held earlier this year. In the 2023 assembly polls, the Congress with 135 seats decimated the BJP toreturn to power in the state. The 
 saffron party was reduced to 66 seats. The other key player in the state politics, the JD(S) of former Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda, also fared poorly and was reduced to 19 seats from the 37 it held in 2018
 However, the Congress leaders and planners would do well to remember that in 2013 also the grand old party had fared wel in the assembly elections winning 122 seats against the BJP' 40. However, this convincing 
 victory in the state polls had little impact on the national elections that followed. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP won 17 seats with a vote share of 43.37% while the Congress could manage only 9 with 
 41.2% vote share.</pre></b>
